        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          While some simple issues like replacing a filter can be done at home, many problems require 
          professional expertise. Attempting complex repairs on your own can void warranties, 
          risk personal safety, and often lead to more costly damage. Our team ensures 
          <strong>appliance repair</strong> is handled safely, correctly, and efficiently the first time.
